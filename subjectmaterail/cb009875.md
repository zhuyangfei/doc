### note:

## user case
1. adet receive syscom data form l1pf
2. adet publish RANNIC static data to OAMBB

## design
As the message ID reuse the previous, so there are some derived requirement and design, such as
1. the adet receive multi message among 1.2 seconds sent form l1pf, then the adet will only publish the last data.
2. only both AdetStatusProvider and AdetL1L2Provider are ready, then the attributes will be published.
